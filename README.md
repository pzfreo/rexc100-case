# Inverted PID Controller Enclosure (Inkbird DIN 1/16)

A robust, 3D-printable enclosure designed for a PID temperature control system. Designed for UK plugs. This design features an "inverted" shell architecture for easy printing and a passive "chimney effect" cooling system for the Solid State Relay (SSR).

## 📋 Features
* **Inverted Design:** The main shell prints upside down (roof on the build plate), requiring minimal supports.
* **Chimney Cooling:** Intake vents in the base and exhaust vents in the lid create a natural updraft through the SSR heatsink.
* **Friction Clamp Mounting:** A unique "Anvil & Hammer" system secures the Inkbird controller without needing difficult-to-remove stock brackets.
* **Reinforced Mounts:** "Dog-bone" reinforcement for the mains socket prevents boss snapping.
* **Configurable Fasteners:** Switch between self-tapping screws (prototyping) or heat-set inserts (production) in the code.

## 🛠️ Bill of Materials (BOM)

### Electronics
| Component | Spec / Search Term | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **PID Controller** | Inkbird ITC-100 (1/16 DIN) | Standard 48x48mm front panel. |
| **SSR & Heatsink** | 25A SSR + DIN Rail Heatsink | Footprint approx 50x80mm. |
| **Power Inlet** | C14 Fused Switched Inlet | Standard 3-pin PC style inlet with rocker switch. 40mm mounting hole separation |
| **Mains Output** | UK 13A Socket (Panel Mount) | Standard 73mm square faceplate. |
| **Thermocouple** | K-Type Thermocouple + Terminal Block | 2-pole ceramic or plastic block. |

### Fasteners (Hardware)
* **Case Screws:** 4x M3 x 12mm Countersunk (for base plate).
* **Internal Mounts:** M3 Button Head or Cap Head screws (Lengths vary: 6mm - 10mm).
* **Clamp Screw:** 1x M3 x 15mm (approx) for the PID friction clamp.
* **Inserts (Optional):** M3 Brass Heat-Set Inserts (if running in Production Mode).

## 🖨️ Printing Guidelines

### Recommended Settings
* **Material:** **PETG or ABS/ASA**. (PLA is **not recommended** due to heat generated by the SSR).
* **Nozzle:** 0.4mm or 0.6mm.
* **Layer Height:** 0.2mm.
* **Infill:** 20-30% Grid or Gyroid.
* **Perimeters:** 3 walls minimum (for strength around screw bosses).

### Orientation
1.  **Shell (`pid_inv_shell.stl`):** Print **Upside Down** (Flat roof on the build plate).
    * *Supports:* Generally not required if your printer bridges well, but check the C14 cutout.
2.  **Base (`pid_inv_base.stl`):** Print flat on the build plate.

## 💻 Generating the Files (Python)

This project is defined parametrically using `build123d`. You can modify dimensions or toggle screw types by editing `case3b.py`.

### 1. Prerequisites
You need Python installed. Then install the CAD library and visualizer:

```bash
pip install build123d ocp-vscode
````

### 2\. Configuration (`case3b.py`)

Open the script and look for the configuration switch at the top:

```python
# False = Prototype Mode (Small pilot holes for M3 self-tapping screws)
# True  = Production Mode (Large holes for M3 heat-set inserts)
USE_INSERTS = False 
```

### 3\. Running the Script

To generate the STL files, simply run:

```bash
python case3b.py
```

  * This will create `pid_inv_shell.stl` and `pid_inv_base.stl` in the same directory.
  * It will output the dimensions in the console.

### 4\. Visualizing the Design

To view the 3D model interactively (with "Ghost" components for fitment checking):

1.  Open `case3b.py` in VS Code.
2.  Run the script using the **OCP CAD Viewer** extension in VS Code.

## 🔧 Assembly Guide

### 1\. The PID Friction Clamp

The PID controller is held in place by a clamp mechanism built into the case:

1.  Slide the Inkbird controller into the front cutout.
2.  Locate the threaded hole in the block **below** the controller (accessible from the open bottom).
3.  Insert a long M3 screw.
4.  As you tighten, the screw pushes the PID body **UP** against the solid brace (Anvil) near the roof, locking it in place.

### 2\. SSR Mounting

  * Apply a small amount of thermal paste between the SSR and the Heatsink if separate.
  * Mount the SSR assembly onto the two raised pillars on the Base Plate.
  * Ensure the grill slots are not blocked by wires.

### 3\. Wiring

  * **Thermocouple:** Route the stiff wire through the 3-pillar "Labyrinth" strain relief before connecting it to the terminal block.
  * **Cable Clearance:** Ensure the C14 power cables are bent sharply (90°) immediately after entering to avoid hitting the SSR.
